# Pomorph

A simple Pomodoro timer.

Made for my final project in CS50x.

The site is built with [Lume](https://github.com/lumeland/lume), the static site generator. The timer itself is a hodgepodge of HTML (Pug), CSS (Sass), and vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

- Set desired work, short break, and long break intervals (supports 1â€“55 minutes). Pomorph remembers the last used time for each.
- Play, pause, and stop a session
- Toggle optional sound effects
- Lifetime stats: number of work sessions, average work session length, and total work time
- Client-side. No server-side database, just local storage in your browser.
- Terrible logic and lots of bugs from a wannabe designer who is learning web development
